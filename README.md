RockPaperScissorsLizardSpock
====================

RockPaperScissorsLizardSpock is the Week 7 project I worked on at [Makers Academy](http://www.makersacademy.com).
We created an interface to let two user play [RockPaperScissorsLizardSpock](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock-paper-scissors-lizard-Spock), written in JavaScript, and tested with the [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/) framework.

====================

The project has been developed through 4 versions:

	1. Implementing the Rock-Paper-Scissors game logic in Javascript following the Ruby unit given to us, to make all of the Jasmine tests pass.

	2. Adding two new options into the mix: Lizard and Spock, and creating custom winning messages that applied to any possible game result.

	3. Build a simple game interface, using JQuery event handlers to handle player choices and return the messages.

	4. Deploy to Heroku as a simple Sinatra application.

====================

The programming languages and technologies I used are:

  * Javascript

  * JQuery

  * Jasmine

  * Sinatra
